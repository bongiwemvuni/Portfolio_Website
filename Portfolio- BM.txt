			<p>
                         I am a dedicated and flexible professional with strong programming skills in Python, Java, C#, SQL, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and WordPress. 
                         My ability to quickly learn and adapt allows me to excel in problem-solving and tackle any challenges presented. 
                         I also have extensive experience in technical support, where I gained expertise in the installation, configuration, 
                         and maintenance of computer systems and printers. 
                         I'm continuously seeking opportunities to expand my skill set and deepen my technical knowledge, am always striving for growth and improvement.
